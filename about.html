            Artist Hayley Nelson has been drawing professionally for 4 years, exhibiting her artwork online
            and vending at various events and conventions throughout the state of Texas. At her shows she is generally
            accompanied by her service dog Blue, for whom the studio is named in part.
            <br>
            Hayley came up with the name "Chasing Blue" from her two beloved pets: Chase, a five year old grey and white
            tabby, and Blue, a four year old red heeler mix and Hayley's psychiatric service dog. </div>
